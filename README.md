# Tekton-Pipelines
This repo is an example for Tekton Piplines, it intended to bridge the gap of the Tekton docmentation and the Tekton newbie.

The repo has 2 folders Part-1 and Part-2.
- Part-1 deals with the Tekton Pipelines, it shows a very simple examnple, to let the reader follow and know the basic entities and continues to real everyday example of Pulling a Private repo, building a container image via Kaniko and pushing the image to private image registry.

- Part-2 deals with Tekton Triggers, it shows a simple pipeline with a trigger(git push/PR) and then it combines it with the Pipeline we have created at Part-1.

This way we try to get a clear picture via the very simple examples and we see a more complex picture via a real everyday usage.

## How to read the examples
 obviuosly start with Part-1 with the README which will show you through the simple-example to the real example, after that stage you would have most of the knowledge you need to create Pipelines.
Then go over Part-2 and again follow the README which will show you through the simple-example for trigger, using the simple pipeline from the Part-1 and the Trigger example with the real example.
