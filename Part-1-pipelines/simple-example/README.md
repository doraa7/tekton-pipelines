# Part 1 Tekton Pipeline - Simple Example

This is an example of defining the proper resources for the Tekton Pipelines.
In this example you will have a single task **add-task** used twice in the pipeline.
In the=is example you will get to know the different entities in a Pipeline, though the example does not show all types, still it is a relaxed intro.

## Running the example
To run the example follow the follwing steps in which we will refernce the flow and different entities.

  Note, this pipeline is taken from the Tekton examples for the concept of Pipeline **results**
  [see here](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/examples/v1beta1/pipelineruns/pipelinerun-results.yaml)

### Steps:

- #### Step 1 - Create Cluster
use Kind/ Minikube for your localhost 

- #### Step 2 - Install TektonCD Pipelines
  Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/install.md#installing-tekton-pipelines-on-kubernetes)

- #### Step 3 - Install(define) the Pipeline & Pipelinerun


  What we define here is several things, we will go from Top to Bottom:
  - Piplinerun is the running of the Pipeline
    The pipelinerun would define the external resources used by the Pipeline e.g. parameters, secrets, workspaces (and volumes) and other PiplineResources.

```
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: sum-three-pipeline-run
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: sum-three-pipeline
  params:
    - name: first
      value: "2"
    - name: second
      value: "10"
    - name: third
      value: "10"
  ```  
  Here we see that the Pipelinerun is running a pipeline named *sum-three-pipeline* and is supplying 3 parameters

  Pipeline would define the Tasks invloved in the Pipeline and all the usage of the resources by the tasks.

  ```
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: sum-three-pipeline
spec:
  params:
    - name: first
      description: the first operand
    - name: second
      description: the second operand
    - name: third
      description: the third operand
  tasks:
    - name: first-add
      taskRef:
        name: add-task
      params:
        - name: first
          value: $(params.first)
        - name: second
          value: $(params.second)
    - name: second-add
      taskRef:
        name: add-task
      params:
        - name: first
          value: $(tasks.first-add.results.sum)
        - name: second
          value: $(params.third)
  results:
    - name: sum
      description: the sum of all three operands
      value: $(tasks.second-add.results.sum)
    - name: partial-sum
      description: the sum of first two operands
      value: $(tasks.first-add.results.sum)
    - name: all-sum
      description: the sum of everything
      value: $(tasks.second-add.results.sum)-$(tasks.first-add.results.sum)

  ```

Here we see that the Pipeline is composed of 2 Tasks *first-add* snd *second-add*.
These 2 Tasks are using the same defined task *add-task* but with different parameters.
More over we can see the defined results of the Pipline that are connected to the created results by the Tasks.
Note the way we write to results
```results.<param-name>.path``` 


and the way we reference results
```tasks.<task-name>results.<param-name>.path``` for example 
```
$(tasks.first-add.results.sum)
```

 - #### Step 4 - Install(define) the Task

The Task is the basic building block taht is composed of steps.
Each Task would be manifested by a POD while each step would be a container in the POD.
In this task we see that it gets 2 parameters and it writes a result sum ```echo -n $((${OP1}+${OP2})) | tee $(results.sum.path)```

This task is then used in the Pipeline via 2 tasks
```
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: add-task
spec:
  params:
    - name: first
      description: the first operand
    - name: second
      description: the second operand
  results:
    - name: sum
      description: the sum of the first and second operand
  steps:
    - name: add
      image: alpine
      env:
        - name: OP1
          value: $(params.first)
        - name: OP2
          value: $(params.second)
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
      args:
        - echo -n $((${OP1}+${OP2})) | tee $(results.sum.path);

```

 - #### Step 5 - running the Pipeline
  Note, when we run the *Pipeline* via *Pipelinerun*, each task is manifetsed via *taskrun*, which is a resource that supplies the resources to the *tasks* in the same way *pipelinerun* supplies resources to *pipeline*.

  To run the pipeline we need to install the resources to kubernetes:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f ./Part-1-pipelines/simple-example/pipeline.yaml
  ```
Now, to execute the Pipelinerun
```
Part-1-pipelines/simple-example/pipelinerun.yaml
```


### Install Tekton CLI tkn
